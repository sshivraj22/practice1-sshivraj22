tips to working with git and github

Sundar Shivraj
I am learning to become a lead programmer to push for innovation and invention within the realm of technology. I seek to push the bounds of reality and pursue the next big dream, the next big idea, the next big goal.
My three main activities are: Leading a Bible Study, Working at SIC, and being a member of the LAS I+E Academy (Innovation + Entrepreneurship)
The three tools I use in organizing my work are: use a planner, have good time management, and ask for help when you need it.
